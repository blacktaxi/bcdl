A little script for downloading Bandcamp albums. 

Installation/Usage
------------------

1. lein deps
2. lein run --album-url <album URL>

Usage
-----

Run with a --help command line parameter to get help.

Why?
----

This script is intended for improving my personal convenience, as there is a lot of great music but sometimes artists do not allow neither buying or free downloads. 
Please do not abuse this, as it might be illegal. If you can -- please buy the music, it is totally worth it.

Legal
-----

This software comes as is, without any warranties whatsoever; it can be illegal as well, I don't know. It is intended only for (my) personal use.
